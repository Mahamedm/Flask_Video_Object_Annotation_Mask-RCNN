# Flask_Video_Object_Annotation-Mask-RCNN
The Flask Video Object Annotation - Mask RCNN project is a web-based application for annotating and labeling objects within video content. The project utilizes the Mask RCNN deep learning model to perform object detection and segmentation within the video. The user will be able to upload a video and the application will then process the video to detect and highlight the objects within the content. The user will then be able to label and annotate the objects, which can be useful for a variety of tasks such as object recognition, data collection, and machine learning training data generation. The project is built using the Flask web framework, providing a user-friendly interface for object annotation and a fast and efficient processing pipeline powered by the Mask RCNN model.
